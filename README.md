# GitHub Beautifier

GitHub launched its new WebUI on Jun 23. Buttons, labels, almost everything becomes circles. I can't stand to see them every day.

So, I built this Chrome extension, **Github Classic Theme**, to bring something I familiar back.

The extension is small and quick since it only injects CSS to Github pages to override some styles, w/o any calculation after DOM rendered.



The extension improves the experience in the following ways,

1. Decreases the `border-radius` of buttons and labels but keeps most indicators in circles,
2. Aligns the repo navigation bar to its contents.



The version of the extension will be the date of GitHub updated. So, the first version is `2020.6.23`. I will update the extension once it isn't compatible with the future version of GitHub.
